#### What is autism:
Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a developmental disorder that affects communication and behavior. Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, it is said to be a “developmental disorder” because symptoms generally appear in the first two years of life. 
Autism is known as a “spectrum” disorder because there is wide variation in the type and severity of symptoms people experience. ASD occurs in all ethnic, racial, and economic groups. Although ASD can be a lifelong disorder, treatments and services can improve a person’s symptoms and ability to function. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children be screened for autism. 
People with ASD have difficulty with social communication and interaction, restricted interests, and repetitive behaviors. 
Doctors diagnose ASD by looking at a person’s behavior and development. ASD can usually be reliably diagnosed by the age of two. It is important for those with concerns to seek out assessment as soon as possible so that a diagnosis can be made, and treatment can begin.

#### fMRI data:
An fMRI scan is a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan that measures and maps the brain’s activity. An fMRI scan uses the same technology as an MRI scan. An MRI is a noninvasive test that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create an image of the brain. The image an MRI scan produces is just of organs/tissue, but an fMRI will produce an image showing the blood flow in the brain. By showing the blood flow it will display which parts of the brain are being stimulated. <br>
