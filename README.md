#### fMRI data:
An fMRI scan is a functional magnetic resonance imaging scan that measures and maps the brainâ€™s activity. An fMRI scan uses the same technology as an MRI scan. An MRI is a noninvasive test that uses a strong magnetic field and radio waves to create an image of the brain. The image an MRI scan produces is just of organs/tissue, but an fMRI will produce an image showing the blood flow in the brain. By showing the blood flow it will display which parts of the brain are being stimulated. <br>
